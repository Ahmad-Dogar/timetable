Inteligent timetable management system using PHP


This is the Intelligent Timetable Management System for universities. This innovative web-based application simplifies the complex process of assigning available rooms, professors, subjects, and departments to create a comprehensive timetable that maximizes efficiency and minimizes conflicts.

The system's intelligent algorithm takes into account the availability of rooms and professors, as well as the unique requirements of each department, to generate a customized timetable that meets the specific needs of your university. The application also includes built-in break times and LABs to ensure that the timetable meets the highest standards of accuracy and quality.

One of the standout features of this project is the ability to print timetables of specific professors, allowing administrators to easily see where all of a professor's lectures are assigned. Additionally, the system provides real-time updates to ensure that administrators are always up-to-date on any changes or conflicts that may arise.
